# Hello, welcome

Hello, this is the first post for my blog. Actually basically it is just a test post to make sure that my markdown is working and to get a feeling for the formatting.

I built this generator myself using

- react

- marksy

- styled components

Here is a [link](https://github.com/makeupsomething) to my github. I want to style links quite simply.

> quotes should also be interesting

```html
<div>
<p>Let's try some code, like HTML</p>
</div>
```

or css

```css
color: green;
margin: auto;
width: 50%;
```

how about python?

```python
def testFunc():
    print("Hello World!)
```
