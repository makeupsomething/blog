# Hello, welcome

Hi all. Not much to say here. This is just a post to get my blog up and running. I am hoping to blog regularly in the new year so look out for more posts then.

Instead of using a pre-built blogging platform I decided to build my own and so you might notice some rough edges or lack of features. For example there is no easy way to share this extremely awesome content on social media (people won't know what they are missing out on ðŸ˜±) But I will be continually working on it so I hope that will improve.

So until the next post. Have a happy new year! ðŸŽ‰
